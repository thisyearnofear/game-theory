### 3.3 Enhanced Single-Player Modes
- **Campaign mode** with progressive difficulty
- **Challenge scenarios** (noise, reputation, etc.)
- **Achievement system** with XLM rewards
- **Leaderboards** for single-player performance

## 🏆 Phase 4: Advanced Game Theory Concepts & Tournament System (Future)
**Goal**: Expand beyond single-round Prisoner's Dilemma to include iterated games and tournaments like the original Nicky Case project

### 4.1 Iterated Games Contract
- **Multi-round gameplay** with memory of past interactions
- **Strategy implementation** on-chain (Tit-for-Tat, Grudger, Pavlov, etc.)
- **Trust evolution tracking** over multiple rounds
- **Real XLM stakes across multiple rounds** for enhanced learning
- **Historical move analysis** for strategy adaptation

### 4.2 Tournament System Contract
- **Automated tournaments** with multiple strategy types competing
- **Performance tracking** for different algorithmic strategies
- **Strategy registry** for different approaches (Cooperator, Defector, Tit-for-Tat, etc.)
- **Population dynamics simulation** showing how strategies evolve
- **Prize pool distribution** via smart contracts

### 4.3 Real-Time Multiplayer
- **WebSocket integration** for live games
- **Matchmaking system** based on skill/stakes
- **Spectator mode** for learning
- **Chat system** with moderation

### 4.4 Advanced Blockchain Features
- **Reputation NFTs** that evolve with gameplay
- **Strategy marketplace** for trading AI algorithms
- **Governance tokens** for community decisions
- **Cross-chain integration** for broader reach

## 🏗️ Contract Architecture Redesign (Technical)
